# ParallaxScrolling

<h1>Project Overview: Parallax Scrolling</h1>
    <p>The "Parallax Scrolling" project was part of the Computer Science Project 1 (IP1) in the second semester. The goal was to create a website with parallax scrolling as a design element. Five people were involved.</p>
    
  <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Development of a target group-oriented website using parallax scrolling.</li>
        <li>Implement storytelling to enhance the user experience.</li>
        <li>Creation of the website using suitable frameworks and tools.</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>Story:</h2>
    <p>As part of the project, a story was developed that revolves around the protagonist Finn, a friendly and clever fox. Finn travels to different continents and discovers exciting facts about famous sights and the nature of our planet. This story is specifically designed to appeal to the website's young target group (children aged seven to eleven). By traveling with Finn, children learn interesting facts about the world in a fun and entertaining way. Finn's adventures begin in Europe and take him on to Africa and Asia, with the possibility of extending the journey to other continents in the future. This interactive and child-friendly presentation ensures that children are not only informed, but also inspired and entertained.</p>
    
   <h2>Technology and Implementation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Parallax scrolling was realized by using CSS, JavaScript and the framework "skrollr.js".</li>
        <li>The framework allows both vertical and horizontal scrolling, the latter being chosen for the simulation of a journey through different continents.</li>
        <li>The content was implemented using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, using SVG files for high resolution and scalability of the graphics.</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>My Tasks:</h2>
    <p>Implementation of the African continent (SVGs and Implementation)</p>
